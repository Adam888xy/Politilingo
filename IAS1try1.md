## Under IAS 1, what defines a "fair presentation" of financial statements, and how does it relate to compliance with IFRS?
**Answer:**
- **Fair presentation** means financial statements:
  - **Faithfully represent** transactions/events.
  - **Comply fully with IFRS** (no exceptions unless immaterial).

- **Non-compliance** is permitted only if it achieves fair presentation (rare, with detailed explanations).

**Example:** Disclosing contingent liabilities even if not recognized under IAS 37.

## According to IAS 1, what is the "going concern" assumption, and how must management assess it?
**Answer:**
- **Definition:** Entities are assumed to operate without liquidation or cessation for the **foreseeable future** (≥12 months).
- **Assessment:** Management must evaluate:
  - Liquidity risks.
  - Debt covenants.
  - Market conditions.
- **If not met:**
  - Disclose **basis for doubt** in notes.
  - Prepare statements on a **liquidation basis** (not going concern).

> **Material adjustments** (e.g., impairment, onerous contracts) must reflect non-going concern status.

## How does IAS 1 require the accrual basis of accounting to be applied, and what is the exception?
**Answer:**
- **Accrual basis:** Record transactions when they occur (not when cash is paid/received).
  - Applies to **all statements except cash flows**.
- **Example:** Bonuses earned in 20X3 but paid in 20X4 are recorded in 20X3.
- **Exception:** Cash flow statements use **cash basis**.

**Contrast with cash accounting:**
| Accrual Basis | Cash Basis |
|---------------|------------|
| Records when earned/incurred | Records when cash moves |
| Matches revenue/expenses | No matching principle |

## Under IAS 1, how are materiality and aggregation applied in financial statements?
**Answer:**
- **Materiality:** Items are material if omission/misstatement could influence decisions.
  - **Factors:** Size (e.g., >10% of net income) or nature (e.g., executive bonuses).
- **Aggregation:**
  - **Material items:** Disclosed separately.
  - **Immaterial items:** Combined (e.g., sundry expenses).

> **IFRS Practice Statement:** Guides judgments but allows subjectivity (e.g., firm-specific thresholds).

**Example:** A $5,000 manager bonus is always material due to nature, even if small.

- **Goodwill formula:**
- **Asset rationale:** Represents **future economic benefits** (e.g., brand value, customer relationships).

**Example:**

- **Indicators:**

## How is non-controlling interest (NCI) measured under IFRS 10?
**Answer:**
- **Two methods:**
1. **Proportionate share** of net assets (NCI = % ownership × subsidiary's equity).
2. **Fair value** (market price of NCI shares).
- **Impact on goodwill:**
- Method 1: Goodwill includes only parent's portion.
- Method 2: Goodwill includes 100% (parent + NCI shares).

**Example:**  
| Method | NCI 20% | Goodwill |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Proportionate | $16K (20% × $80K net assets) | $20K |
| Fair value | $25K (market price) | $29K |

| **Structure** | No separate vehicle | Separate vehicle (e.g., JV company) |
| **Rights/Obligations** | Direct rights to assets/liabilities | Rights to net assets |

## What are the three measurement models under IFRS 17 for insurance contracts?
**Answer:**
1. **General Model (BBA):**
 - **Contractual Service Margin (CSM)** + Risk Adjustment.
 - For most insurance contracts.
2. **Premium Allocation Approach (PAA):**
 - Simplified method for short-duration contracts.
3. **Variable Fee Approach (VFA):**
 - For contracts with direct participation features.

**Key metric:** **Liability for Remaining Coverage (LRC)** = Fulfillment cash flows + CSM.

---

## How are insurance contract modifications treated under IFRS 17?
**Answer:**
- **Substantive modification:** Treat as new contract + derecognize original.
- Criteria: Changes to cash flows > **10%** of original.
- **Non-substantive:** Adjust CSM prospectively.
- **Derecognition:** When obligations expire or are transferred.

**Example:** Increasing coverage by 15% → New contract.

## Under IAS 28, how is the equity method applied to associates?
**Answer:**
- **Initial recognition:** At cost.
- **Subsequent measurement:** Adjust for investor's share of:

- Dividends received (reduce carrying amount).
- **Impairment:** If carrying amount > recoverable amount.

**Journal Entry (profit):**  
Debit: Investment in associate  
Credit: Share of profit of associate

- Parent's share eliminated (Dr. Dividend income, Cr. Dividends paid).

**NCI impact:** Allocate elimination based on ownership %.
