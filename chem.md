# Chemistry Flashcards

## What is the chemical symbol for water?

**H₂O** is the chemical symbol for water. It consists of *two hydrogen atoms* and *one oxygen atom* covalently bonded together.

## What are the three main states of matter?

The three main states of matter are:

1.  **Solid**: Maintains a fixed volume and shape.
2.  *Liquid*: Maintains a fixed volume but takes the shape of its container.
3.  ~~Gas~~: Has no fixed volume or shape; it expands to fill its container.

## Explain the difference between an element and a compound.

> An **element** is a pure substance consisting only of atoms that all have the same numbers of protons in their atomic nuclei.
> A `compound` is a substance formed when two or more different chemical elements are chemically bonded together.

## What is the process by which a solid changes directly into a gas?

The process by which a solid changes directly into a gas is called **sublimation**. A common example is dry ice (solid CO₂).

## Define the term 'mole' in chemistry.

In chemistry, a *mole* is a unit of measurement that represents exactly $6.02214076 \times 10^{23}$ elementary entities (such as atoms, molecules, ions, etc.). This number is known as Avogadro's number.

## What is the pH scale and what does it measure?

The pH scale is a logarithmic scale used to specify the acidity or basicity of an aqueous solution. It typically ranges from 0 to 14. A pH of 7 is neutral, a pH less than 7 is acidic, and a pH greater than 7 is basic (or alkaline).

## Explain the concept of isotopes.

Isotopes are atoms of the same element that have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons. For example, Carbon-12, Carbon-13, and Carbon-14 are all isotopes of carbon.

## What is the difference between a physical change and a chemical change?

- A **physical change** is a change in the form of a substance, but not in its chemical composition. Examples include melting ice or boiling water.
- A *chemical change* involves the rearrangement of atoms and the formation of new substances with different properties. An example is the burning of wood.

## Describe the basic structure of an atom.

An atom consists of a central **nucleus** containing positively charged protons and neutral neutrons. The nucleus is surrounded by negatively charged electrons that orbit the nucleus in specific energy levels or shells.

## What are the main types of chemical reactions?

Some of the main types of chemical reactions include:

1.  Synthesis reactions (A + B → AB)
2.  Decomposition reactions (AB → A + B)
3.  Single displacement reactions (A + BC → AC + B)
4.  Double displacement reactions (AB + CD → AD + CB)
5.  Combustion reactions (reaction with oxygen, often producing heat and light)
