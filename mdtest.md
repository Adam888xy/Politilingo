# What is the periodic table?

The **periodic table** is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements, organized by:

1. **Atomic number** (number of protons)
2. **Electron configuration**
3. **Recurring chemical properties**

Elements are presented in **order of increasing atomic number**. The rows are called *periods* and the columns are called *groups*.

# Explain the difference between ionic and covalent bonds

Chemical bonds can be categorized into different types:

## Ionic Bonds
* Form between **metals** and **non-metals**
* Involve complete **transfer of electrons**
* Create charged particles called **ions**
* Example: NaCl (table salt) Na⁺ and Cl⁻

## Covalent Bonds
* Form between **non-metals**
* Involve **sharing of electrons**
* Create molecules with shared electron pairs
* Example: H₂O (water) with shared electrons between H and O

> The electronegativity difference determines the bond type. Generally, a difference greater than 1.7 indicates an ionic bond.

# What is the pH scale and what does it measure?

The pH scale measures how **acidic** or **basic** a substance is.

* pH stands for "**p**otential of **H**ydrogen"
* Scale ranges from **0 to 14**
* pH of 7 is **neutral** (pure water)

| pH Range | Classification | Examples |
|----------|----------------|----------|
| 0-3      | Strong acid    | Stomach acid, lemon juice |
| 4-6      | Weak acid      | Coffee, tomatoes |
| 7        | Neutral        | Pure water |
| 8-10     | Weak base      | Baking soda, soap |
| 11-14    | Strong base    | Drain cleaner, lye |

The pH value is mathematically defined as:
